## What the v...DOM?

<details>
 <summary>Elevator pitch</summary>
Everybody talks about the vDOM but who knows how it works? How virtual is it in reality? And why does it work so well? This talk looks at vDOM implementations, compares approaches and brings some light into the topic by building yet another vDOM library.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Longer description</summary>
The talk will start by showing an example application using Preact highlighting the benefits of the glory vDOM. Preact is not the primary focus though.

The Goal is to build a tiny vDOM implementation from scratch and to create a library step by step going from the render function over event handling to diff mechanisms. This way the audience gains a core understanding of the vDOM, different approaches and will learn that it's not that mystical as it sounds.

The talk also includes analyses of example libraries like lit-html or hyperHTML to make clear that it‚Äôs all more or less the same (or not). ;)

## Let‚Äôs chat about a11y! First: reacting the right way...

<details>
 <summary>Elevator pitch</summary>
How hard can it be to build a proper accessible and inclusive single page application? Let's find out and have a look at a chat application written in React, figure out problems and fix them together.

  <summary>Details</summary>
The talk will start explaining the importance of an accessible and inclusive web followed by the state of JavaScript. Today developers tend to care more about developer experience rather than user experience.

To show what is needed to build accessible React application the main part of the talk will explain and implement accessibility concepts on an example chat application.

Part of the topics to be covered will be:
- focus handling
- document title handling
- role="alert", aria-live aria-atomic
- semantic markup
- things to avoid

Tooling and ways to automatically detect accessibility issues will be on the finish line of the talk to give the audience an immediate action item for their work. It will be mentioned though that especially in the world of accessibility not everything is detectable and it still needs human eyes to build most accessible products.

  <summary>Audience pitch</summary>
Hello audience! üëãüèª

In this talk you'll learn about core accessibility and inclusive design principles that are overlooked very often in the world of Single Page Applications. Products we build today should work for everybody but unfortunately the state of the web shows something else. It's more about the latest tech trend rather then good product. 

Let's have a look at what it takes to build a React app that doesn't exclude people from using it.

## I didn't know that

<details>
  <summary>Elevator pitch</summary>
Web Development is a constant journey of new technologies and new things to learn. A year ago I started documenting and sharing all the tiny things that I didn't know before and stopped being anxious about others thinking that I'm not smart. Let me tell you what I learned!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
In 2017 I discovered ~50  things in WebDev that were unknown to me. These are now documented on my blog. The fun thing is that these are sometimes very advanced but sometimes also very basic. 

In this talk, I want to share a lot of nitty-gritty details of JavaScript, CSS and web technologies in general but also want to take away the fear of the audience to say "I don't know that" and show the power of starting a routine that helps to gain and remember knowledge.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Outline</summary>
I'll start the talk with a personal story everybody knows ‚Äì the story of not knowing things. 

We all tried to look smart in front of other people, we all decided to gloss over the fact that we don't know something in the one or other situation and we all thought that the well-known people out there know everything (which is not true).

After this bridge, I tell the story how I started documented my learnings, and I'll pick the best learnings listed on my blog (https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/)... I see it as a "best of" collection of good learnings and facts.

To close the talk, I want to talk about the feedback I got on my "Today I learned" series which was very positive. It motivates me every time I post something and hopefully it will motivate the audience to start saying "I don't know" and maybe also sharing their findings, too.

## Your Frontend developer thinks in Components and so should you

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The way we build things for the web changed drastically over the past years. Everything these days is about components. It started with living style guides that should help designers to not always reinvent the wheel from page to page and ended with frameworks like React, Angular and Vue are the de-facto standard to write rich web application ‚Äì completely component driven. Does this mean that we also have to rethink our approach to content management? Let‚Äôs have a look!
